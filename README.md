# sapui5-bas-cf-sample-app
Business Application Studio generated sample application to test, build and deploy to Cloud Foundry with the ui5 pipeline.

This application uses karma to run the tests. To do this a sidecar container running headless chrome is started, next to the node container.

For a description on how to setup a freshly generated BAS app please follow this guide: [enable-pipeline.-run.md](./enable_pipeline_run.md)
